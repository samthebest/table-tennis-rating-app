Genius!


## TODO

- [ ] Add all the infrastructure code - and make a script to automatically generate the notebook.
- [ ] timestamps as datetime for easier human reading
- [ ] Alter algorithm to calculate rating adjustment on a day-by-day (configurable time interval) basis (rather than after every game).
- [ ] Progress plots
